1. To play elevens, you need a deck with 52 cards with the jokers taken out. 
   private instance variables:
     list of all cards
     list of dealt cards
     list of undealt cards
     deck size
     rank of card
     point value of card(to add up to 11)
2. shuffle the deck
   deal out cards
   check if there are any possible combinations that add up to 11 or are 3 cards that are a king, queen, and a jack
       if there are possible combinations:
           decide which cards to remove
           remove the cards
           check if there are enough cards in the deck to replace the removed cards
               if there are:
                   replace the removed cards with new ones from the deck
               if there aren't:
                   replace as many cards as you can
       if there aren't any possible combinations:
           you lose
           put all the cards back in the deck
           start over
3. yes
4A. in the constructor
4B. isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible
4C. the returned list of integers contains 5 elements
              +---+---+---+---+---+
              | 0 | 1 | 3 | 6 | 7 |
              +---+---+---+---+---+
4D.public static void printCards(ElevensBoard board){    
     List<Integer>cIndexes=board.cardIndexes();
     String result="cards:";
     for(int i=0;i<cIndexes.size();i++){
       result=result+" --- "+cards[cIndexes.get(i)];
     }
     System.out.println(result);
   }
4E. isLegal because it checks which cards are selected to see if it is a legal combination
